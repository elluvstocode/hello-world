# hello-world
my first Git repository

Hi Everyone!

I was introduceed to coding in July 2013 and have been excited ever since. I became interested in coding after reading an article from Google about bringing in more women into STEM. I linked over to Ruby on Rails interactive tutorial and started learning code on my own.
